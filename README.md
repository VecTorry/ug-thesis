ROAD MAP:
1) [DONE] Verify use of Google's Teachable Machine model for use into web based system if feasible.

2) [DONE] System will be able to read captured test poses trained on TM (Teachable Machine) and display the detected pose live with confidence score for the user to see.

3) [DONE] System will log individual detected poses for 1 frame every second, then output the full list of all the poses into what ever is compatible for analyzation.

4) [Done] The log & records will be summarized into a pop-up tab which could also be automatically or manually downloaded after user prompt.

5) [DONE] Deploy the system to be accessible through the use of internet instead of a local host with a local port.

6) [Done] Add in extra CSS designs to make the system more visually appealing and user-friendly.

7) [IN PROGRESS INDEFINITELY] Maintain the deployed software and fix post-deployment bugs.
