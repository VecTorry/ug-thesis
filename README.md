KNOWN ISSUES:
1) None


NEXT TASK:
- Log labeled poses: capture 1 frame every secondm, then log the different postures that were recognized.


ROAD MAP:
1) [DONE] Veriy use of Google's Teachable Machine model for use into web based system if feasible.

2) [DONE] System will be able to read captured test poses trained on TM (Teachable Machine) and display the detected pose live with confidence score for the user to see.

3) [IN PROGRESS] System will log individual detected poses for 1 frame every second, then output the full list of all the poses into what ever is compatible for analyzation.

4) The log will be analyzed by another AI which would summarize into a detailed reported if a user has had a bad or good posture, and will provide recommendations for improvement.

5) Deploy the system to be accessible throgh the use of internet instead of a local host with a loca port.

6) Add in extra CSS designs to make the system more visually appealing and user-friendly.

7) Maintain the deployed software and fix post-deployment bugs.
